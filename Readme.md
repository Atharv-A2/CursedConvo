Welcome to **CursedConvo**, a real-time chat application built with **Django**, **Django Channels**, and **WebSockets**. This project allows multiple users to join a chat room, send messages in real-time, and view a list of online members.

- **Multicolored Bubble:** For clear distinction between users, different color is assigned.
- **Emoji Support:** All types of Emoji are supported into the Chat Text.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend:** Django, Django Channels, Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **WebSocket Protocol:** Real-time bidirectional communication(Django ASGI)
- **Deployment:** Daphne (ASGI server)

## **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atharv-A2/CursedConvo.git
cd CursedConvo
```

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment**

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Step 5: Configure the Application**

1. Verify the `CHANNEL_LAYERS` setting in `settings.py` to use InMemory Channel:

   ```python
   CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
      "default": {
         "BACKEND": "channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer",
      },
   }
   ```

2. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Run the Application**

Start the Django development server with Daphne:

```bash
daphne CursedConvo.asgi:application
```

---

### **Step 7: Access the Application**

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/
```

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Join the Chat**

- Enter a unique username to join the chat.
- If the username is already taken, you'll be prompted to choose a different one.

### **2. Send Multiple and Consequent Messages**

- Type your message in the input box and press **Enter** or click **Send**.
- Your message will be broadcast to all users in the chat room.

### **3. View Online Members**
